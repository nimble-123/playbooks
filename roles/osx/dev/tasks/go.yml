  homebrew: name=go state=latest install_options=cross-compile-common
# Notes:
# formula: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/go.rb
# Downloads the latest tar.gz source release and runs ./make.bash once for each
# target platform. --cross-compile-common ensures that all target architectures
# for the linux, windows, and darwin OSs are built.
#
# Installs go source workspace to /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.5/libexec. The archived
# packages for each target can be found in pkg. Homebrew symlinks /usr/local/bin/go
# to /usr/local/Cellar/1.5/bin/go, which is itself a symlink to ../libexec/bin/go.
# The same is done for the gofmt executable.
#
# Be sure to set the GOPATH to your workspace and (optionally) add its bin dir to
# your PATH (PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin).
